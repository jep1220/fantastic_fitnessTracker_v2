## Front-end
Handlebars are used along side with CSS and JS to build a responsive, good looking app.
## Back-end
NodeJs, Express, MySQL, Cookies and sequilization are used to build a dynamic application.
## Usage
Before running to start, create your database on MySQL first. Then, use the .env.EXAMPLE to create your .env with your database name, user name, and password. Next, on your command line run  (npm run seeds)  to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.
Finally, to be able to test your back end routes with Postman, Insomnia Core or similar application, run on your command line ( npm start ) to start your local server.
##  :arrow_down: Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
npm i
It will install express, sequelize, mySQL, bcrypt and dotenv.
* Express is used to create our server side.
* Sequelize and mysql are used to creates a connection between your MySQL database and this application.
* dotenv will protect your credentials. Check .env.EXAMPLE to see what you need on your .env file.
## Test
Use postman, Insomnia Core or similar application to test GET and POST routes for this back end application.
